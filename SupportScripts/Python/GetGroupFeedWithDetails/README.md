## Get feed data from a list of groups with details
  
**Language:** Python v3.7

This usecase example shows how to get all [posts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/reference/graph-api/post) from a given list of [groups](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/reference/graph-api/group) and obtain all their details.

To run this script, edit the code to add the required variables (ids of groups and access token) and save the code as `group_posts_detail.py`. Run the script in a command line as follows:

python group_posts_detail.py

It will print in console the data in dict format. Ideally, you would want to export the data varibale to an external file (i.e. CSV).
