## Get feed data from groups in detail
  
**Language:** Python v3.7

This usecase example shows how to get all [posts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/reference/graph-api/post) from a given list of [groups](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/reference/graph-api/group) and obtain all their details.

To run this script, edit the code to add the required variables (ids of groups and access token) and save the code as `group_posts_detail.py`. Run the script in a command line as follows:

python manage_groups.py

It will print on screen information in dict format about the given groups. Ideally, you would generate a CSV file with this information.
